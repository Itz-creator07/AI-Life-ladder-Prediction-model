<h2>🧠 About This Project</h2>

<p>
  This project uses machine learning to predict the <strong>Life Ladder score</strong>, a measure of self-reported well-being, based on various socio-economic and political indicators. The dataset comes from the <strong>World Happiness Report</strong> and includes features such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceived corruption.
</p>

<h3>🔍 Objective</h3>
<p>
  To build a supervised regression model that predicts how “happy” a country is, using real-world metrics like economics, health, and governance. The model helps uncover drivers of well-being and supports better decisions in policy, resource allocation, and social development.
